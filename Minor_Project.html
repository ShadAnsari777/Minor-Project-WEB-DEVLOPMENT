            <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble
                mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631
                by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
                it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)
                complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides
                by a crenellated wall. <br>
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of
                the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans
                under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court architect.
                Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity. <br>
                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art
                in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by
                many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal
                attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7
                Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p>

            <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that
                served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the
                Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and
                white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The
                fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace
                architecture with Indian traditions.<br>

                The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in
                1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the
                Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was
                subsequently used as a garrison. <br>

                On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the
                Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian
                tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.

                The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex </p>

        <div class="heading"><h1>Amer Fort</h1></div>
        <div class="box" id="box3">
            <img src="amer.jfif" alt="Image is Loading">
            <p>Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of 4
                square kilometres (1.5 sq mi)[2] located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan.
                Amber city and Amber fort were founded by ruler Alan Singh Chanda of Chanda dynasty of Meenas.
                Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur. Amer Fort is known for
                its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort
                overlooks Maota Lake, which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace. <br>

                Amer Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of
                Mughal architecture. Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace
                is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public
                Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai
                Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water
                cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace. The
                palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near
                the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a Goddess of the Chaitanya cult,
                which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now
                in Bangladesh).Raja Man Singh had 12 queens so he made 12 rooms, one for each Queen. Each
                room had a staircase connected to the King’s room but the Queens were not to go upstairs. Raja Jai Singh
                had only one queen so he built one room equal to three old queen’s rooms.
                <br>This palace, along with Jaigarh Fort, is located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of
                Eagles) of the same Aravalli range of hills. The palace and Jaigarh Fort are considered one complex, as
                the two are connected by a subterranean passage. This passage was meant as an escape route in times of
                war to enable the royal family members and others in the Amer Fort to shift to the more redoubtable
                Jaigarh Fort. Annual tourist visitation to the Amer Palace was reported by the Superintendent
                of the Department of Archaeology and Museums as 5000 visitors a day, with 1.4 million visitors during
                2007. At the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2013, Amer
                Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the
                group Hill Forts of Rajasthan.

            <img src="qutub.jfif" alt="Image is Loading">
            <p>The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms
                part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi’s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi,
                India. It is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city, mostly built between 1199 and
                1220. <br>
                It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190, which was
                constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are
                elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is
                fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage.In
                general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they
                exist</p>

        <div class="heading"><h1>Konark Temple</h1></div>
        <div class="box" id="box5">
            <img src="konark.jfif" alt="Image is Loading">
            <p>Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast from Puri city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India. The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE. <br>

                Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high, much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga architecture.
                 <br>
                The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and still remains a source of controversy. Theories range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the course of being sacked several times by Muslim armies between the 15th and 17th centuries.This temple was called the "Black Pagoda" in European sailor accounts as early as 1676 because it looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black. Similarly, the Jagannath Temple in Puri was called the "White Pagoda". Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the Bay of Bengal. The temple that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British India-era archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February. <br>
